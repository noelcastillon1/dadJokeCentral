# Objectives

- Our team sought to create an app that would allow dads to find community amongst like-minded practical jokesters. Dad Joke Central will serve as a cornerstone of the dad community by collecting user-created dad jokes, allowing members to determine which jokes showed the most paternalistic sense of humor, and allowing users to manage personal user profiles.

# Optimization

- Given more resources to invest in this project, our team would have like to: 
  - Improve the voting system, with the option to remove likes and add dislikes to a post
  - Add a sort function where users can order posts by parameters such as total likes and date posted
